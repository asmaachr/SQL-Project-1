## Process
### Create the table and identify data type
### Cleaning the data
### Explore data run queries for comparison
### Identify the problem that I am trying to solve ( questions)
### Identify additional information from dat

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
It was really chanlenging to understand and clean the table without SME inputs
Many colunm have similar names but not with same values
Time was very limitted so I had to proceed with some assumptions
Difficulty to reconciale revenue numbers

## Future Goals
Ask SME about the meaning of some colunms
clean better my data
Remove colunm with not input for the problem
