# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

In this project, my goals are as following:
-Clean the data
-Transform the table to be more meanful for future -analysis without redundancy and Non useful information
-Understand the data without inputs from Subject Matter Experts(SME) through some preminalery analysis
- Answer required answers
- develop some queries for the QA process and assess the risk
- Personal goal: get familiar with SQL coding

## Process
-Create the table and identify data type
-Cleaning the data identify primary and foreign key when possible
-Explore data run queries for comparison
-Identify the problem that I am trying to solve ( questions)
-Identify additional insights fromm data

## Results

 1-US/ San Francisco has the highest value if ignore the unknown cities
2- It seems that everywhere the average product ordered by visitor is equal to one
3- It seems to point-out to product category Home/Nest/Nest care in US mainly
4- It seems that the product that is top for many cities is Nest@ Learning Thermostat 3rd gen
5- Please refer to table summarized by percentage by city/country

Further results:
Some Skus with these product name are out of stock

## Challenges 
-It was really chanlenging to understand and clean the table without SME inputs
-Many colunm have similar names but not withsame values
-Time was very limitted so I had to proceed with some assumptions
Difficulty to reconcilate revenue numbers

## Future Goals
Ask SME about the meaning of some colunms
clean better my data
Remove colunm with not input for the problem
Updated by Mds file as I do my work
